## Abstract
For this project, we want to use big data tools to improve Chicagoâ€™s public safety. We selected a data file about crimes occurring in Chicago on Kaggle. The original source of the data is provided by Chicago Police Department. By analyzing this dataset, we want to explore the characteristics of crimes in Chicago, including time, location, severity, and potentially predict trends of future crimes and come up with plans for Chicago police and residents, to help improve public safety in Chicago. To simplify the thinking process, we divided the problem into 5 different parts. The first two parts focus on the general characteristics of crimes happening in Chicago, including the description, time, and location of those crimes. The next two parts focus on examining the danger level and severity of those crimes. The last part attempts to make the prediction of future crimes, giving a clear guideline for the public safety sector in Chicago. We utilized Hadoop and HDFS to upload the data file onto the server. We then utilized different tools such as PySpark, MapReduce, and Hive to process the data file, and get necessary data. To visualize the results, we used tools such as Wordclouds, Tableau, and DataWrapper. We also included tools such as Second Exponential Smoothing when making predictions for future crimes.
